# 🎮 Game Analytics Dashboard: User Behavior & Revenue Insights

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** project that analyzes player behavior, monetization trends, and retention patterns for a gaming platform. This dashboard provides key insights into Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU), revenue performance, churn indicators, and user segmentation by game mode, device type, and more.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was built to help stakeholders understand:

- What's working in terms of player engagement and revenue
- What behavioral patterns point to early churn
- Which user segments (device/game mode) generate the most value
- How we can improve **retention** and **monetization**

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **DAU / WAU / MAU Tracking**  
  Measure daily, weekly, and monthly active users to understand engagement trends.

- **Revenue Analysis**  
  Visualize total revenue over time, average revenue per user, and breakdowns by device and game mode.

- **User Segmentation**  
  Identify user cohorts by revenue bucket (Low, Medium, High, Very High) and play behavior.

- **Churn Detection**  
  Spot users at risk of churn using login gaps, session activity, and usage frequency.

- **High-Value User Insights**  
  Profile the top revenue-generating users and understand their characteristics.

## 🧠 Insights Summary

| Focus Area         | Key Finding |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Engagement**      | Mid-level session users (8–30 sessions) form the largest group |
| **Churn Risk**      | 13.9% of users show churn signs, especially those with <7 sessions |
